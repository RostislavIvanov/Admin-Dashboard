    desc: `<p>Over the years, Apple has built a reputation for releasing its products with a lot of fanfare ‚Äì but that didn‚Äôt exactly happen for the MacBook Pro 2018. Rather, Apple‚Äôs latest pro laptop experienced a subdued launch, in spite of it offering a notable spec upgrade over the 2017 model ‚Äì along with an improved idboard. And, as with previous generations the 15-inch MacBook Pro arrives alongside a 13-inch model.</p>
          <p>Apple still loves the MacBook Pro though, despite the quiet release. This is because, while the iPhone XS and iPad, along with the 12-inch MacBook, are aimed at everyday consumers, the MacBook Pro has always aimed at the creative and professional audience. This new MacBook Pro brings a level of performance (and price) unlike its more consumer-oriented devices.</p>
          <p>Still, Apple wants mainstream users to buy the MacBook Pro, too. So, if you‚Äôre just looking for the most powerful MacBook on the market, you‚Äôll love this new MacBook Pro. Just keep in mind that, while the idboard has been updated, there are still some issues with it.</p>
          <p>There‚Äôs enough of a difference between the two sizes when it comes to performance to warrant two separate reviews, and here we‚Äôll be looking at how the flagship 15-inch MacBook Pro performs in 2019.</p>
          <p>It's build quality and design is batter than elit. Numquam excepturi a debitis, sint voluptates, nam odit vel delectus id repellendus vero reprehenderit quidem totam praesentium vitae nesciunt deserunt. Sint, veniam?</p>`,
